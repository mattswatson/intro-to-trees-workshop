# Introduction to Decision Trees Workshop

This repository contains all material for the N8 CIR Introduction to Decision Trees workshop. These are adapted from [The Carpentries Incubator](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-trees-python/index.html) - feel free to modify them for your own use.

# Running the notebooks

The notebooks should be worked through in numerical order. For the workshop, they can be ran directly from [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) using the following links:
